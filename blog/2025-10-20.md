# CLI Tools Update - October 20, 2025

Today there have been three updates to [command-line tools](https://github.com/aarons/cli-programs).

## gc 1.0.1

URL detection no longer flags words that correspond to TLDs as URLs when they end with a period at the end of a sentence. For example, "this isn't it." -> "it" is no longer flagged as a domain.

## git-merge (new tool)

This is a new automated git branch merging tool. This will automate the workflow of merging a feature branch into main.

There are two code paths, the default simplest is to call `git-merge` while in a feature branch, which will merge everything to main and push the changes to origin.

The other code path is to do a squash merge, which will provide context about the merge to `gc` and generate a  conventional commit message based on the branch's git history.

## update-cli-programs 1.4.0

The installer now works from any directory instead of requiring execution from the repository root.

All tools are available from https://github.com/aarons/cli-programs.
